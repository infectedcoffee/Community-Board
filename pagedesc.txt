Project aim: create a free space that can be used for either crypto trading and a monitored* forum that's minimalistic as possible.
(* MONITORED - Users are free to use the message posting system, if it adheres to anti-hate speech regulations. This implies that cursing is not allowed.)

Thanks to apache and ubuntu this Open Source web page was able to be created.
